# Open TD

## What

Some sort of tower defense game ever so slightly inspired by [Rogue Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843760/Rogue_Tower/).

This is now in a playable state! [Try it out](https://lorgan3.github.io/open-td/) or [Watch the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3L1v3RezDY)

## Why

I've just thrown together everything that I find really intriguing such as procedural generation and path finding. I've also sprinkled some vue on top to try it out and finally a random idea to render a game with just emojis. Trying to turn this simulation into a game is basically just an afterthought, what could possibly go wrong?

## Running

You need to have Node & Yarn installed. Simply run the following commands to start the game.

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Dev

I've developed this with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the following plugins

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Check `package.json`, there are also commands available to run tests and check the types.
